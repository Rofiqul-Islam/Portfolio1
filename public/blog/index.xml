      <description>Cyber-physical-social systems exploit the relationship between humans, computers, and the physical environment to provide high-quality real-time and personalized services. Provisioning services for applications in networks of large datacenters (DCs) is carried out as service function chaining (SFC) by linking ordered list of functions. With the development of software, defined networks and network function virtualization, SFC has gained more attention in the industry for deploying larger applications. Provisioning different service functions (SFs) of an SFC in different DC in a multi DC environment is a challenging task.</description>

      <description>Provisioning services for applications in networks of large data-centers is carried out as service function chaining (SFC) by linking ordered list of functions. With the development of software defined network (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV), SFC has gained more attention in the industry for deploying larger applications. Provisioning different virtualized functions (VFs) of an SFC in different data-centers in a multi data-center environment is a challenging task. Existing works on serving SFC select a service function path (SFC) along which the VFs are executed.</description>

      <description>Dhaka, one of the world’s megacities , is also among the list of least livable cities. Overcoming Dhaka’s problems calls for disruptive thinkers and innovators to find solutions with the help of Information and communication technology. The main purpose of the Hackathon was to come up with implementable digital solutions to reduce the impact of the problems faced daily in city life. As Grameen Phone constantly learns, evolves and improves on its digital journey, it takes in some of its best learning opportunities from the community.</description>
