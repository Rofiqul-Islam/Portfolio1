shortDescription: Log is a great source to detect business events. Parsing and minning log file can give us the whole scenarion of business process of a large project which can be very complicated. In this project I have run static analysis on microservice project to extract business process and generate Business Process Graph.
challenge: Extracting the log by static analysis and sort them into correct runtime order is the main challenge for this research project.
solution: I have used a Java library to parse java project and find out all variables, function calls, log statements then sort them according to runtime execution order. To achieve this, I had used graph optimization algorithm. At last this graph was used to generate business process graph.
