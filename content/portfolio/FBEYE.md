shortDescription: Using social media perfectly is a great challenge for visually impaired people. The content of normal social media's like - Facebook, Twiter, Instagram, Linkedin are mostly designed for visualize. But we need to come up with a solution to improve this situation. FBEYE is a project that makes possible to use Facebook for visually impaired people. We designed and include a complete voice interaction mechanism with normal Facebook to faciliate it for blind person.
challenge: First main challenge of this project was designing the system for blind people. Since blind people can not see, giving input and navigating around social media pages were quite hard. Second challenge was to convert text to voice. And the last one was process posts and images on facebook account.
solution: Firstly, we take decision that we will build this system for those blind people who know how to type using keyboard. There are special keyboard for blind people and learning to type with it is very easy for blind people. We give direction for navigating using voice commands and also read it out which button they pressed, which will give them flexibility to correction. For the second challeges we had used a feature of HTML5 which can convert text to voice. And for the last one we had used Google's free API for image and text processing and finding out the main idea of posts or images.
