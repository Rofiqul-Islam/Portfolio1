Dhaka, one of the world’s megacities , is also among the list of least livable cities. Overcoming Dhaka’s problems calls for disruptive thinkers and innovators to find solutions with the help of Information and communication technology. The main purpose of the Hackathon was to come up with implementable digital solutions to reduce the impact of the problems faced daily in city life. As Grameen Phone constantly learns, evolves and improves on its digital journey, it takes in some of its best learning opportunities from the community. The Smart City Hackathon was a platform to do just that: learn, co-create and incubate great ideas, using in this case, White-board, Grameenphone’s inhouse innovations centre, can play an enabling role. To do this, GP’s White Board, in associaltion with Prenuer Lab, organized the 36-hour hackathon. The program was inaugurated by the North Dhaka City Corporation mayor Mr. Annisul Huq, along with Grameenphone CMO Mr. Yasir Azman, CTO Mr. Mehhat El Husseiny, and other officials from Grameenphone and Preneur Lab.
